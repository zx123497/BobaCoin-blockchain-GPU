# Lab 4: Choose-your-Own Distributed System

As indicated in the lab writeup, you have an opportunity to design and implement your own distributed system, service, or application.  There is a lot of flexibility, so we aren't providing you with starter code.  This nearly empty repo should be your starting point, and you can build off any of your previous lab outcomes.  As usual, please use this repo for your project work, so the course staff can help you along the way
